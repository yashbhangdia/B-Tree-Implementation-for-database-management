# B-Tree-Implementation-for-database-management
A B+ tree implementation in C for performing CRUD operations on a sample student database.
Requirements: compiler (ex. g++)

The operations include:
* Inserting records
* deleting records
* updating records
* reading records from the file (database).
* Searching for a particular value in the database.
B+ tree was used here for performing efficient searching and retrieval of data.

The program runs on a g++ compiler and gives options to user about what instructions the user can give to program and manage the file accordingly.
